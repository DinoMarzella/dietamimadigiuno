The process is complex, and each pathway can interact with other pathways, but in general, PKA responds primarily to sugar and carbohydrates, while IGF-1 is primarily responsive to protein (and more strongly triggered by animal protein), and mTOR is triggered by IGF-1 and amino acids. Sugar and carbohydrates (and to some extent caffeine) will activate PKA. These nutrient-sensing pathways all help regulate the cells’ growth cycles and stress-resistant “fasting” state.<\/p>"}},"6555fd45-102a-47de-a0cb-eb390bd1be2b":{"type":"faqs","settings":{"question":"What happens to my body during the fasting mimicking program?","answer":"<p>ProLon provides the body with a scientifically developed, naturally occurring combination of macronutrients (fats, carbohydrates, proteins) and micronutrients (essential vitamins and minerals) designed to keep the body nourished while going through the rejuvenating process of the fasting state. <\/p><p>WHAT HAPPENS ON DAYS 1 TO 5 ON MY PROLON FAST?<\/p><p>Day 1: Transforming to a Fasting State: Your body is transitioning to a fasting state and fat- burning mode, and begins preparation for cellular clean-up.<\/p><p>Day 2: Fat Burning & Ketogenesis: Fast Burning & Ketogenesis: Fat-Burning ramps up, contributing to the initiation of ketogenesis (ketone production).
