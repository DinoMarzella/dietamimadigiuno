As we age, our cellular capability to detox, recover and heal decrease and older senescent cells outnumber young vibrant cells.\n        <br><br> \nOur ancestors had a natural secret to defend against accelerated aging and to rejuvenate younger cells: proLonged fasting (> 3 days). When fasting, the body uses its reserves (fat and glycogen) for the first 2 days (Intermittent Fasting period) but when fasting crosses 3 days or more (the prolonged fasting period), the body undergoes a next level of ‘protective and rejuvenative defense called autophagy.\n        <br><br> \nIn modern days, we accelerate cellular damage and aging vs going into periods of autophagy, recovery and rejuvenation.In 5 short days ProLon allows your body to go into a rejuvenating state, while consuming macro and micro nutrients to keep your body nourished.\n\n        </div>",

Follow the \"instructions\" for the soups and they shouldn't be hard or gritty (some need stove top cooking for 15 mins). I am lucky that I enjoy olives, the crackers and the nut bars were delicious, it's food after all : ) I have just completed round 3. It really does get easier with each round. My one criticism - the beautiful packaging and plastic bottle are completely unnecessary. I think Prolon should scale that down a bit. THANK YOU Prof Longo for the decades of hard work and study.",
