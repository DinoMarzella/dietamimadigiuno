I never really experienced any hunger, and I've already ordered another kit to use in a few months. I feel like after years of being unsuccessful with yo-yo DIETING I am now on my way to achieving not only the weight loss I've been longing for, but I'm on my way to much better health via great nutrition and exercise. Thank you, Dr. Longo and your team for all your hard work!!! What a wonderful product! I bought the Longevity Diet book and the recipe book is on its way to me!! Thank you so much!!",

The process is complex, and each pathway can interact with other pathways, but in general, PKA responds primarily to sugar and carbohydrates, while IGF-1 is primarily responsive to protein (and more strongly triggered by animal protein), and mTOR is triggered by IGF-1 and amino acids. Sugar and carbohydrates (and to some extent caffeine) will activate PKA. These nutrient-sensing pathways all help regulate the cells’ growth cycles and stress-resistant “fasting” state.</p>"
