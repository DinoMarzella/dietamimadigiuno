Your body is also starting to get into cellular clean up mode, also known as autophagy. This can be a tough day for some, as you are transitioning into more of a fasted state, and ketosis will generally happen later today into tomorrow. It’s also normal to feel a bit cold in a fasting state, as your body shifts into a resting mode. Make sure to stay well-hydrated!<br><br>\nTip:Soak the soups in water for an hour before cooking if possible and use a whisk to mix the soups while cooking. This step is entirely optional, so if you don’t want to soak, just follow the different cooking instructions to ensure your soups are fully cooked and ready to enjoy.\n<br><br>\n\n          <\/p>","box_cont_wrap":"","box_color_new":"#ffffff"}},"16345888848170b3f8":{"type":"image-slider","blocks":{"16345888848170b3f8-0":{"type":"image_slider","settings":{"image_slid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/tomato_soup_SV2_e7b6c4d2-f133-4920-bb54-2350bec28ae8_1200x_2.png"}},"e8125375-40e2-4305-8983-b0816feef271":{"type":"image_slider","settings":{"image_slid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/minestrone_soup_SV1_b630c2cd-ec05-4071-9341-b1519b2a4a57_1200x_1.png"}},"485510c9-a547-42ce-8bd3-65e5d4b5792a":{"type":"image_slider","settings":{"image_slid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/l-bar_nut_SV1_66d362a6-0f8f-46c4-b9be-74483601aa15_1200x_1.png"}},"fac8b719-9249-440e-8051-e88dbbbc5a94":{"type":"image_slider","settings":{"image_slid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/l-bar_choco_SV1_1200x_0bd939e8-58d4-49bc-bfbd-b484d2b332af.png"}},"a34531e3-42e9-42b3-af3d-819e4d8b5353":{"type":"image_slider","settings":{"image_slid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/kale_crackers_SV1_ba0fe8ce-bb04-433a-b656-7bca310a57a4_1200x_1.png"}}},"block_order":["16345888848170b3f8-0","e8125375-40e2-4305-8983-b0816feef271","485510c9-a547-42ce-8bd3-65e5d4b5792a","fac8b719-9249-440e-8051-e88dbbbc5a94","a34531e3-42e9-42b3-af3d-819e4d8b5353"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"nutri_header":"NUTRITION FACTS"}},"1634628103b3fb56e3":{"type":"nutrition-app","disabled":true,"settings":{"mini_title":"Get Connected :","right_bg_color":"#c7893e","text_main_title":"JOIN FASTINATION","main_para_app":"Join ProLon’s fasting tribe and interact with fellow ProLon fasters.
