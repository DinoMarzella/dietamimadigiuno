For example, there’s the 16:8 intermittent fasting method, which offers an eight-hour window of eating, and 16 hours spent fasting. The 5:2 intermittent fasting method takes that cycle a step further, with five days of regular eating coupled with two days of fasting, or 2 days of reduced caloric intake (500 calories for women, 600 calories for men). There’s also the method of doing an intermittent fast in accordance with your circadian rhythm, which means, eating during a 12-hour window, and fasting from after dinner until breakfast the next morning, making up the other 12-hour window.","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_disabled":false,"button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","layout":"left","color_scheme":"none","divider":false}}},"order":["1633645645eca03860","1633645932b36bfa3c","1633645982829ba8c1","1633645993449bd491","1633646809827827da","1633656104853f8151"]}
