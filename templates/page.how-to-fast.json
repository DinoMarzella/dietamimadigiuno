For instance, if someone’s last meal of the night was at 7:00 p.m., they would want to have their next meal at 7:00 a.m. the following morning.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>16:8 Diet<\/strong> - Similar to the 12:12, this TRE plan shortens the eating window by 4 hours to extend the time the body is in a fasting state. Here, the person would only have 8 hours in which they can eat each day, with the remaining 16 hours devoted to a complete fast. However, it is not recommended to skip breakfast during this fast, as recent research shows there could be a negative impact on heart health.  If you want to practice 16:8, and were planning to skip breakfast, we suggest you replace your meal with our new Fast Bar™ to provide your body with sustenance while also introducing a heart healthy bar that features the technology of the Fasting Mimicking Diet (see below for more information).<\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Fasting-Diet-Page-Mobile-2_540x_1080x_4b9c3557-ab9d-4b29-ac30-a8583176f6dd.jpg","use_video_html":false,"overide_image":"","image_on_left":true,"remove_padding":false,"background_color":"#ffffff","image_max_width":"500px","tag":"HOW TO FAST"}},"c987120f-7588-4e9d-a6b4-ed31ee414e442":{"type":"TWProlonBenefits","blocks":{"7d012482-52e0-423c-83a9-63e018f05a4a":{"type":"cards","settings":{"title":"Prolonged Fast (PF)","description":"PROLONGED FAST (PF):  Also known as periodic fasting, this approach calls for a fast that goes beyond 2 days (most often somewhere between 4 and 7 days).
