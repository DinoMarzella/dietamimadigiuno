The most common example of this is known as the “5:2” diet, where calories are severely restricted for 2 days (preferably non-consecutive), and then normal eating occurs for the other 5 days in the week. Other intermittent fasting programs include complete fasts where no food is consumed for a specific length of time (commonly 16-24 hours), also non-consecutive days per week.\n<br><br>\n\n\nWhile weight loss and fat burning results can be substantial with intermittent fasting programs, benefits that promote changes at the cellular level require a type of fasting program that extends beyond 48 hours."}},"07132300-1fd9-49fa-8830-0a88fc06d020":{"type":"cards","settings":{"title":"Prolonged Fasting<br>\n(PF)","description":"The prolonged fasting diet is basically fasting for an extended period; usually anywhere from 4 to 7 consecutive days. The main goal of this type of fasting diet is to initiate the stress of fasting onto the body over the course of several days which stimulates innate changes at the cellular level to help promote health. An example of a prolonged fast would be either a water fast for a series of 3-7 consecutive days (which should always be done under the care of a physician) or the potentially safer and easier to complete ProLon Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) where specific foods can be eaten while still allowing the body to remain in a fasting state and experience many of the same benefits.\n<br><br>\n\n\nTo learn more about ProLon’s 5-Day Fasting Mimicking Diet and its ability to enhance cellular renewal, click here.\n<br><br>\n<a class=\"py-2 px-4 cursor-pointer border \" href=\"\/pages\/fasting-mimicking-diet\">\n              Fasting Mimicking Diet\n            <\/a>"}}},"block_order":["ff81f51d-3637-4956-a989-2842700ef4e7","a0bae3fa-e950-4183-9d7c-5aa500fa33c9","07132300-1fd9-49fa-8830-0a88fc06d020"],"settings":{}},"41378070-42d8-4445-85cb-30c6159075f7":{"type":"TWOnlyImage","settings":{"desktop_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/shutterstock_1392193913_1_3024x_d979e9d4-e628-4e2a-af3e-2e8a18779e43.jpg","mobile_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/shutterstock_1392193913_1_3024x_d979e9d4-e628-4e2a-af3e-2e8a18779e43.jpg","max_height":"600px","under_header":false}},"8ac686a2-1a05-416c-a857-6cbc070ee4ee":{"type":"TWImageWithText","blocks":{"66f965f1-4a3b-46b2-acb7-471cce796d29":{"type":"buttons","settings":{"text":"ORDER NOW","url":"shopify:\/\/products\/prolon-offer-v1","button_type":"primary"}}},"block_order":["66f965f1-4a3b-46b2-acb7-471cce796d29"],"settings":{"pretitle":"","title":"Ready to try Fasting with Food™?","description":"You’re going to love ProLon Fasting Mimicking Diet\n\n<br><br>\n\nGet the benefits of a 5-day fast without giving up food with ProLon, the first and only patented 5-Day Fasting Mimicking Diet.
