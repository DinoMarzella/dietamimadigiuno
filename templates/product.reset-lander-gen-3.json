This newer formulation along with fewer calories, is derived from the science behind the 5-day ProLon Fasting Mimicking Diet and is specifically designed to support intermittent fasting (IF) routines. We have designed ProLon ReSet to fit a 5:2 Diet which is an intermittent fasting diet that allows people to eat their regular diet 5 days a week and then limit calories on the other 2 (non-consecutive) days. You can use ProLon ReSet on your fasting days for IF up to a day or as part of your 5:2 diet routine, depending on your needs and lifestyle. <\/p><p><em>*Based on the fasting mimicking technology of ProLon.<\/em><\/p>"}},"85d0879e-58a1-4d36-b208-64a27fe71c5d":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"Nutritional Facts","text":"","align_text":"center"}},"482f01d6-512e-4a0f-bde9-0607f83e4654":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Soups","text":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column501\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/tom_soup.png?v=1643753084\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"column501\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/butternut_squach_soup_SV2_9b57bb46-00e6-4544-a5b1-ba717b677ef5.png?v=1643752631\"><\/div>\n<\/div>"}},"955c2f39-a133-4545-89b3-41217de58926":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Bars & Snacks","text":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column301\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/FB_Facts_-_Honey_720x_869140b7-9f94-432e-8748-7d26f8cd406e.png?v=1643752631\" style=\"background-color: white;\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"column301\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/IF_Bar_Facts.png?v=1643753960\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"column301\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/Almond-Kale_Crackers.png?v=1643753960\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"column301\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/Olives_-_SeaSalt.png?v=1643753960\"><\/div>\n<\/div>"}},"4c925bb3-67f8-47bf-836a-b6ef61d07810":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Drinks","text":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column501\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/22_PL_Teas_Nutrition_Facts_d6b752c7-018c-484b-b91c-e83eea64f175.png?v=1643752631\" style=\"background-color: white;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>"}},"c74b79bd-f97f-4bea-8700-bac08bf578d4":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Supplements","text":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column501\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/NR-1.png?v=1643753960\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"column501\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0126\/2921\/3243\/files\/Algal_Oil.png?v=1643753960\"><\/div>\n<\/div>"}},"3a8b296d-7a7c-46d5-8b4c-ccdea20ff890":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"Ingredients","text":"","align_text":"center"}},"9f0ec6db-809e-4f30-8cf4-db609d9151fc":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What does the ProLon ReSet kit contain?","text":"<p>ProLon ReSet consists of plant-based soups, bars, snacks, herbal teas, and supplements designed to help support your fasting.
