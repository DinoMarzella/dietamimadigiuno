When you do a ProLon ReSet, you eat while your body thinks it’s fasting because the scientifically designed combination of nutrients does not trigger nutrient sensing pathways. During this 1-day fast, your body’s ketone levels will rise as your body starts to break down fat stores for fuel, and your glucose levels will remain steady – similar to what happens when you’re fasting. </p><p><em>*Based on the fasting mimicking technology of ProLon.</em> </p>"

ProLon ReSet is designed to support intermittent fasting (overnight fasts, and fasts lasting less than two days) as part of an everyday healthy lifestyle.</p><p>If you’re looking for the benefits of prolonged periodic fasting (PF) (longer than 2 days), including support of weight loss and fat loss, cellular rejuvenation, metabolic health, or a jumpstart to lifestyle transformation, we recommend that you try the 5-Day ProLon Fasting Mimicking Diet. Due to its extended duration, PF goes beyond providing weight loss and fat reduction to promote biological fasting and a process known as <em>autophagy</em>, the clean-up of aging and worn-out intracellular components. These cellular cleansing and rejuvenating effects can only be attained through cellular stress such as a prolonged fast like the 5-day ProLon FMD.</p>"

We do not recommend adding a ProLon ReSet day before or after completing 5 days of ProLon, as this has not been tested in any of our studies and may be unsafe in certain people.  </p>"

            "answer": "<p>Prolon Reset is our newest version of a 1-day fast with ProLon. While ProLon Fast Pack offered a way to ease yourself into fasting, ProLon ReSet offers a 1-day fast that has been shown to keep your body in a fasted state*. This newer formulation along with fewer calories, is derived from the science behind the 5-day ProLon Fasting Mimicking Diet and is specifically designed to support intermittent fasting (IF) routines. We have designed ProLon ReSet to fit a 5:2 Diet which is an intermittent fasting diet that allows people to eat their regular diet 5 days a week and then limit calories on the other 2 (non-consecutive) days. You can use ProLon ReSet on your fasting days for IF up to a day or as part of your 5:2 diet routine, depending on your needs and lifestyle. </p><p><em>*Based on the fasting mimicking technology of ProLon.</em></p>"

            "answer": "<p>People practice intermittent fasting for many reasons, including for weight loss and other potential health benefits. In terms of weight loss, by shortening the window of time during which food is consumed, generally fewer calories are consumed overall which can result in weight loss which varies by individual. There are also other potential health benefits associated with synchronizing the fasting window to the sleep cycle (i.e.: not eating after dinner). Benefits you may receive using ReSet vary between individuals, and depend on your overall lifestyle, including exercise, dietary intake on non-fasting days, and other lifestyle choices.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Intermittent fasting (IF) can be defined as fasting for less than 2 days. While there are a variety of fasting methods within the category of IF, they are all based on eating patterns that alternate between intervals of eating and fasting. One popular IF routine is the 5:2 Diet, which entails fasting during specific days of the week. For this approach, individuals either eliminate or severely restrict their calories for two (non-consecutive) days of the week and then resume their normal diet for the other five days. </p><p>Periodic fasting (PF) is fasting for more than two days, usually anywhere from three to seven consecutive days. Due to its extended duration, PF goes beyond providing weight loss and fat reduction to promote biological fasting and a process known as <em>autophagy</em>, the clean-up of aging and worn-out intracellular components. These cellular cleansing, renewing and rejuvenating effects can only be attained through a prolonged fast like the 5-day ProLon FMD. </p>"

Any significant change in diet (including fiber intake) can contribute to changes in your gut such as bloating, cramping and gassiness, constipation or diarrhea.  </p><p>Although ProLon ReSet is designed to reduce many of these risks of fasting by providing specific macro and micronutrients, because it is still a low-calorie diet, we encourage you to discuss with your healthcare provider whether the practice of fasting or the use of fasting mimicking diet is right for you. Please avoid the following during the 1-day program:   </p><p>• Any strenuous exercising or activities that may consume a high level of calories. <br>• Extreme temperature environments like hot tubs and saunas, or driving long distances under strong sun or heat exposure. </p><p>Since ProLon ReSet is a food-based program, please stop the product should you experience any symptom of an allergic reaction such as a rash, change in voice, swelling or fever. </p><p>If you feel light-headed or faint, you should eat something, drink juice, or consume a beverage with sugar.
