This usually occurs on Day 3 of the diet.  That’s the point when cells turn to themselves for nourishment.  They gather their old, worn-out parts that are dragging on their inner workings, break them down, and recycle them. The end result is rejuvenated cells.\n<br><br>\nProLon is more than a diet. It will help your body rejuvenate for healthy aging.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5Day_Meal_Plan_900x_a7bf2ab3-db61-401e-8c00-f53d102b4b1d.jpg","use_video_html":false,"overide_image":"","image_on_left":true,"remove_padding":false,"background_color":"#ffffff","image_max_width":"500px","tag":""}},"4156fcc9-75d0-4b71-990f-2c3b5e15ca05":{"type":"TWImageWithText","settings":{"pretitle":"","title":"Healthier Eating Habits","description":"These days, it’s harder to stay on track with healthy eating habits.  Why? Because we’re all at home more, which means that we have constant access to our pantries.  We snack when we’re hungry, we snack when we’re not hungry, we snack when we’re bored. \n<br><br>\nYes, we snack a lot these days.  And, because most gyms still are still closed, we can’t work out like we used to. \n<br><br>\nThe good news though, is that one of the profound benefits of ProLon is that it can lead to healthier eating habits. Most ProLon users say that they enjoyed less food cravings, were better able to resist sugary foods, and control their meal portions after doing one cycle of ProLon. Most users also say that they’re more motivated to adopt a healthier lifestyle in general.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/What_is_Prolon_900x_e9fb9410-53ae-4c9c-81ed-a755ba296ab9.jpg","use_video_html":false,"overide_image":"","image_on_left":false,"remove_padding":false,"background_color":"#ffffff","image_max_width":"500px","tag":""}},"9e8596bc-79b6-4ef2-ac92-b5dc97b8d43c":{"type":"TWImageWithText","settings":{"pretitle":"","title":"Weight Loss","description":"If you’re looking for healthier eating habits, you probably also care about your weight.
